Beta build 1.2

Almost a complete rewrite, added slash commands:
/mrbigglesworthdeath
/mbd

These can be followed by:
default, sound on, sound off
If you do not specify a command, then instructions will be printed.

Everything works, including playing the optional thunder sound.

Much thanks goes to OrionShock on the wowace.com forums.
